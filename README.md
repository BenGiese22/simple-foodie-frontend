# Simple Foodie Frontend

The Front-End component of Ben Giese's personal project Simple Foodie, a no-clutter and cut to the point Vegetarian Recipe Website. I started this project out of frustration when teaching myself how to cook and experiencing how poor of an experience it is on some websites who add pages of filler to their recipes. When searching recipes, users want one thing first and one thing only first, the ingredients. 

Visit the [Simple-Foodie-Frontend](https://simple-foodie-frontend.herokuapp.com/) website to begin searching for great vegetarian recipes.

Visit [Simple-Foodie-API](http://simple-foodie-api.herokuapp.com/) to see the API I created for this project.
